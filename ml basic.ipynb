    "<p>### Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n",
    "AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and learn. AI includes problem-solving, decision-making, and learning from experience.  \n",
    "**Example:** Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa use AI to understand and respond to human queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Machine Learning (ML)**\n",
    "ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that improve their performance over time.  \n",
    "**Example:** A spam filter in emails that learns to classify messages as spam or not based on past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Deep Learning (DL)**\n",
    "DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. It is particularly effective in tasks like image and speech recognition.  \n",
    "**Example:** Self-driving cars use deep learning to detect objects, recognize traffic signs, and make driving decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns the mapping between input and output based on the provided labels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of supervised learning:**\n",
    "- Email spam detection\n",
    "- Image classification (cat vs. dog)\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Fraud detection in banking\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of ML where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data. The algorithm identifies hidden structures without explicit labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of unsupervised learning:**\n",
    "- Customer segmentation in marketing\n",
    "- Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)\n",
    "- Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix)\n",
    "- Clustering of news articles\n",

    "|------|-----------|---------|\n",
    "| **Supervised Learning** | Uses labeled data to train models. | Fraud detection, sentiment analysis |\n",
    "| **Unsupervised Learning** | Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns. | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection |\n",
    "| **Semi-Supervised Learning** | Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning. | Google Photos auto-tagging system |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set** – Used to train the ML model (largest portion of the data).\n",
    "2. **Validation Set** – Used to tune model parameters and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Test Set** – Used to evaluate the final model’s performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can detect anomalies by identifying patterns that deviate significantly from normal data.  \n",
    "**Example:** Banks use anomaly detection to identify fraudulent transactions based on unusual spending patterns.\n",
